### 2. Layout Structure
- Hero section with key metrics (WordPress-style)
- Quick actions panel (WordPress-style)
- Widget-based sections (Drupal-style)
- Activity feed sidebar (WordPress-style)
- Responsive grid system

### 3. Interactive Elements
- Smooth hover effects
- Loading states
- Expandable sections
- Tooltips for complex metrics
- Contextual help (Drupal-style)

### 4. Information Architecture
- At-a-glance statistics (top)
