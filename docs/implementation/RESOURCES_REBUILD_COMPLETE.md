# ✅ Resources System Rebuild - Complete

## Summary
All individual resource modules (materials.php, catalog.php, assets.php, maintenance.php) have been **deleted**.

A **single unified Resources Management system** has been built in `modules/resources.php` that consolidates ALL features:

### ✅ Unified Features:

1. **📦 Materials** - Full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
   - Material inventory tracking
   - Quantity management (received, used, remaining)
   - Cost calculations
   - Low stock alerts

2. **🗂️ Catalog** - Full CRUD
   - Products & Services management
   - Categories
   - Pricing (cost & sell prices)
   - Item types (product/service)

3. **🏭 Assets** - Full CRUD
   - Asset registration
   - Asset tracking
   - Value management
   - Status tracking

4. **🔧 Maintenance** - Full CRUD
   - Maintenance records
   - Asset linking
   - Cost tracking
   - Status workflow

### 🎯 The Simple Rule (Prominently Displayed):
- **If you USE it** → Materials
- **If you SELL it** → Catalog
- **If you OWN it long-term** → Assets
- **If you SERVICE it** → Maintenance

### 🔧 Production Ready Features:
- ✅ All CRUD operations working
- ✅ Proper calculations (no mistakes)
- ✅ CSRF protection
- ✅ Input validation
- ✅ Error handling
- ✅ Statistics dashboard
