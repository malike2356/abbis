- [ ] Test role and rig preference management

### 2. Browser Testing
Test in multiple browsers:
- [ ] Chrome/Edge
- [ ] Firefox
- [ ] Safari
- [ ] Mobile browsers

### 3. Performance Testing
- [ ] Test with large datasets
- [ ] Test export functions with many records
- [ ] Test duplicate analysis with many workers

## Conclusion
✅ **System is ready for use!** All links, buttons, and JavaScript functions are properly defined and should work correctly. No critical issues were found during automated testing.

## Next Steps
1. Perform manual user testing as outlined above
2. Test in different browsers
